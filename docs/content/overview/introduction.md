# Introduction

An open-source UI component library for building high-quality, design systems and web apps using <a href="https://vuejs.org" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Vue.js</a>.

## Vision

Our vision for `masc-vue` is to provide a comprehensive set of reusable UI components that enable developers to build high-quality, responsive web applications using Vue.js. We aim to simplify the development process by providing a consistent and intuitive API, while also ensuring that our components adhere to the latest web standards and guidelines. Our goal is to empower developers to create beautiful and functional user interfaces that meet the needs of their users, regardless of their devices.

## Key Features

### Leverage daisyui and tailwindcss

Built with `daisyui` and `tailwindcss`, providing a powerful and flexible styling solution that allows you to easily customize the look and feel of your components. `daisyui` provides a set of pre-built components and utilities that work seamlessly with `tailwindcss`, making it easy to create beautiful and responsive user interfaces.

### Styling

Components ship with minimal styles, giving you complete control over styling. Components can be styled with any styling solution (vanilla CSS, CSS preprocessors, CSS-in-JS libraries). Learn more in our [styling](../overview/styling) guide.

### Uncontrolled

Where applicable, components are uncontrolled by default but can also be controlled, alternatively. All of the behavior wiring is handled internally, so you can get up and running as smoothly as possible, without needing to create any local states.

### Developer experience

One of our main goals is to provide the best possible developer experience. We provides a typed API. All components share a similar API, creating a consistent and predictable experience.
